I am a data analyst with a strong background in programming and software development. I enjoy solving problems through code and building practical systems that make life easier.

While I was a student, I activelly participated in hackathons, and <a href="https://devpost.com/mrava"> won 12 </a> competitions across universities on the U.S. East Coast by building iOS and watchOS apps, web applications, desktop tools, and AI-driven projects. These experiences strengthened my problem-solving skills, collaboration, and ability to prototype ideas quickly.

Currently, I am a data analyst at <a href="https://www.monroeu.edu/">Monroe University</a>, where I recreate legacy dashboards in Power BI to support institutional reporting. In addition to analytics work, I build SharePoint sites for my department and maintain the university’s library website using SpringShare’s LibGuides platform.

Looking ahead, I aspire to become a data scientist and continue deepening my foundations in data science through graduate study.

Outside of work, I enjoy learning new songs on the piano, guitar, and bass, playing chess, and watching comedy and science fiction. I also try to stay active by cooking healthy meals and going to the gym, though I sometimes lack motivation to do so consistently.
