My name is Maminiaina Ravaloarison, and I was born and raised in Madagascar. In high school, most of my classmates feared mathematics and felt pressured by it, but I was fascinated by the fact that it was precise, pattern-based, and had only one right answer. I knew I wanted to work in a field that would use this logical thinking, so it became my favorite subject, and it naturally drove my academic choices. 

After high school, I was uncertain about which field of study to pursue, but I knew that I wanted mathematics to be part of it. I spent time reading job descriptions for various majors and soon noticed that, especially for someone from my country, proficiency in English or French was often required. I therefore invested a year studying both languages. 

During this period, I built websites with WordPress in my free time, but I wanted full control over components. I researched solutions online and discovered that websites could be built and modified through coding. The moment I first tried to code was eye-opening; it made me feel like I had a superpower and could build anything with code. I began looking for universities that could teach me programming, but in Madagascar, access to technology is limited and no programs matched my goals. Thus, I applied overseas and learned through Harvard’s CS50 online course while awaiting decisions.
