My name is Maminiaina Ravaloarison, and I was born and raised in Madagascar. In high school, most of my classmates feared mathematics and felt pressured by it, but I was fascinated by the fact that it was precise, pattern-based, and had only one right answer. I knew I wanted to work in a field that would use this logical thinking, so it became my favorite subject, and it naturally drove my academic choices. 

After high school, I was uncertain about which field of study to pursue, but I knew that I wanted mathematics to be part of it. I spent time reading job descriptions for various majors and soon noticed that, especially for someone from my country, proficiency in English or French was often required. I therefore invested a year studying both languages.
